<!--

Thanks for taking the time to file a feature request! Please first search for an existing feature request to avoid creating duplicate requests. If you find an existing feature request, please give it a thumbs-up reaction, as we'll use these reactions to help prioritize the implementation of these features in the future.

If the feature has not yet been filed, then please describe the feature you'd like to see become a part of the SSRP. Please include the following details:

-->

## [Provide a general summary of the feature in the Title above]

### Use case
Describe your use case, providing details of context in which the feature would be helpful, e.g. if you're an instructor using the SSRP in the classroom or a meta-researcher interested in using SSRP data.

### Description of the problem and the proposed solution
Try to frame the problem in general terms (consider its relevance to other SSRP users) and elaborate your proposed solution, providing details on your desired platform feature, where on the website it should be deployed, and how. E.g., are you an instructor looking for additional grading resources for your course? Would that require developing a new website or can it be addressed in the ACRe Guide?

### Link to examples and research
Is there already software that has the behavior you're interested in? What is it, and how does it work?
Can you give a concrete example of how you'd use the feature? A relevant code sample?
What other ways did you try to solve your problem?
Can you draw a picture/make a mock-up of what you're imagining?

### Can you develop or write the feature?
There's no better way to get your feature request implemented than to do so yourself. SSRP is supported by a very small team, so any help is welcome!
